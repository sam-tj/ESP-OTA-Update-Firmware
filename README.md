# ESP OTA Update Firmware

Use this to upload your personal codes via ota updates. 

This is only the base firmware file, so you would need add the OTA commands to your new codes too.

This will create a WiFi access point through which you can connect the ESP to your local wifi router and then install the file via OTA from a URL. Here for demonstration GitHub is used to upload file to ESP (NodeMCU 1.0).
